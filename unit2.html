  <b>Lesson 1: Welcome to the Internet</b>
    <h4>
      Q: How do you use the Internet?

      Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?

    A: I use the internet in order to text my friends and family. This is important to me as I can plan hangouts and meetups with my friends easily because of it. </h4>  </div>

    <b>Lesson 2: Building a Network</b>
    <h4>Q: Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.


  A:Going from A to E to C to D would be one route. Going from A to B to D would be an alternative route. </h4>  </div>

    <b>Lesson 3: The Need for Addressing</b>
    <h4>Q: Pick the two statements that are true about the Internet Protocol (IP):

  A: Each device or computer on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address. IP is the shared way that all devices and computers label their messages with the sender and receiver's addresses.
      Q2: Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.


      A2: by using a common protocol that enables data to be transmitted to every connected device on the Internet via individual IP addresses.

    <b>Lesson 4: Routers and Redundancy</b>
    <h4>Q:  Pick Two: If the post office delivered mail exactly like the routers deliver messages on the Internet, which of the following statements would be true?

  A: The mailman would sometimes take a different path to deliver each letter to your home. Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put inside envelopes
      Q2: What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?
      A2: Higher reliability is the result of more redundancy. Additionally, it facilitates dispersed site management. The idea is that devices should be able to immediately switch over if one fails.

    <div class="wave">
    <b>Lesson 5: Packets</b>
    <h4>Q: Which of the following is true regarding the way information is transmitted on the Internet?

  A:  Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.
    CFU 2: Rules for addressing and sending data across the internet by assigning unique numbers to each connected device = IP + Takes inventory of all packets in the datastream to ensure they are successfully sent and received = TCP + Chunk of data and its metadata, used to route and reassemble information on the Internet = Packet + The way in which information travels on the Internet, not as a single piece but in chunks = Datastream + Sends all packets without checking whether they were received or ordered properly = UDP
