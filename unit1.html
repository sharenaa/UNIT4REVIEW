<b>Lesson 1: Welcome to CSP</b>
    <h4>
      
      Q: What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?
    
    A: My own strategies and insights about how to learn best include visual representations and processing slowly. This is someone to the ones I've heard from the other students as some students would take notes which means a visual representation. Or, processing slowly in order to take in the information rather than just looking/hearing it. Just like the student that took small break-ins. It's different from the others as a student said they'd maximize their ability to focus through rest, but for me I stay active in order to keep myself in check and attention.</h4>

    <b>Lesson 2: Representing Information</b>
    <h4>Q: Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options? 
    
A: It was intended to demonstrate us to binary coding and show us how to handle information more simply by using a message with a sequence of two options.</h4>

    <b>Lesson 3: Circle Square Patterns</b>
    <h4>Q: How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?
      
A: I could explain that its a pattern that has a maximum and minimum, and of which repeats once complete, except with additions (in order) to it.

    <b>Lesson 4: Binary Numbers</b>
    <h4>Q:Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have?
      A: The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system.
      Q2:Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?
  

A2: We generate twice as many distinct integers with each additional bit. 
    Q3:  How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today? 
      A3: 6 bits are neccesary.
       Q4: What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?
     A4: Similar: The binary system is a positional numeral system, just as the decimal system. It means that depending on its position, each digit has a different value. Difference: Most people are familiar with the decimal system, The base-10 number system, which has ten digits (0â€“9) to express values, is another name for it. Binary, commonly known as base-2, simply uses two numbers (0 and 1) in comparison.  </div>

    <b>Lesson 5: Overflow and Rounding</b>
    <h4>Q: Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading? When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?

A: When an car travels more than its maximum reading, the distance traveled is not still displayed. Instead, it starts over at 0. Some numbers are either too big or too little to be represented. Hence, not all conceivable fractions can be created.
    
    Q2:When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?
    
    A2:Some numbers are either too big or too little to be represented. Hence, not all conceivable fractions can be created. </h4>  </div>

    <b>Lesson 7: Black and White Images</b>
    <h4>Q: Which of the following would result in a better digital approximation of an analog black and white image? 
    
A:  Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of samples taken. The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image. The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.
    
    Q2:Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.
    
    A2:  The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image.  The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly.
    
    Q3:Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?
    
    Q4:A sample size of 255 x 255 will produce a fair digital approximation. The pixels in a picture will either decrease/increase when it is resized using the pixelation widget, and when the viewer views the image, the pixels' decrease/rise will cause the image to appear fuzzy. When resized, its original size is either increased/decreased compared to the resampled.</h4>  </div>

    <b>Lesson 8: Color Images</b>
    <h4>Q: Which statement about analog and digital images is true?
    A: Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation. 
    
    Q2: Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.

A2: by providing the computer with information on the location and opacity of the RBG pixel.</h4>  </div>

    <h4>Q: In your own words describe the benefits of creating functions in your code?

A: Functions make programming more efficient and allow for code reuse. They also make it possible for the code to be easier to read and debug.</h4>  </div>
